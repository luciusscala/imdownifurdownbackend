# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Travel Data Parser is a FastAPI-based web service that extracts structured travel booking information from various travel platform URLs. The system will parse flight and lodging booking links to return standardized JSON data for integration with a Next.js travel planning application. This service enables automated data extraction from major travel platforms including Google Flights, Airbnb, Booking.com, and airline websites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a travel planning application developer, I want to send flight booking URLs to an API endpoint, so that I can receive structured flight data in a consistent JSON format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is sent to `/parse-flight` with a valid flight booking URL THEN the system SHALL return structured flight data including origin airport, destination airport, duration, costs, segments, and flight number
2. WHEN the flight URL contains IATA airport codes THEN the system SHALL extract and return these codes in the origin_airport and destination_airport fields
3. WHEN flight duration information is available THEN the system SHALL return the total flight time in minutes as an integer
4. WHEN cost information is available THEN the system SHALL return both total_cost and total_cost_per_person as decimal values
5. WHEN flight segment information is available THEN the system SHALL return the number of stops/segments as an integer
6. WHEN multiple flight numbers exist THEN the system SHALL return the primary flight number as a string

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a travel planning application developer, I want to send lodging booking URLs to an API endpoint, so that I can receive structured accommodation data in a consistent JSON format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is sent to `/parse-lodging` with a valid lodging booking URL THEN the system SHALL return structured lodging data including name, location, guest count, costs, nights, and check-in/out dates
2. WHEN accommodation name is available THEN the system SHALL extract and return the property or hotel name
3. WHEN location information is available THEN the system SHALL return the location as city, country or full address
4. WHEN guest count is specified THEN the system SHALL return the number of guests as an integer
5. WHEN cost information is available THEN the system SHALL return both total_cost as float and total_cost_per_person as integer
6. WHEN date information is available THEN the system SHALL return check_in and check_out dates in ISO format with timezone
7. WHEN stay duration is available THEN the system SHALL calculate and return number_of_nights as an integer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Next.js application developer, I want the FastAPI server to support CORS for localhost:3000, so that my frontend application can make cross-origin requests to the travel parser API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FastAPI application starts THEN the system SHALL configure CORS middleware to allow requests from http://localhost:3000
2. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is received from localhost:3000 THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN POST requests are made from the Next.js application THEN the system SHALL accept and process these requests without CORS errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that I receive meaningful error messages when requests fail or URLs are invalid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid URL is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with a descriptive error message
2. WHEN a URL is unreachable or returns 404 THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with timeout/connectivity error details
3. WHEN parsing fails due to missing data THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with parsing failure details
4. WHEN request processing exceeds timeout limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with timeout error message
5. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry-after information
6. IF any parsing error occurs THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive error details for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle multiple travel platforms, so that users can parse links from various booking sites without platform-specific endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Google Flights URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and extract flight data using Google Flights-specific parsing logic
2. WHEN an airline website URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and extract flight data using airline-specific parsing logic
3. WHEN an Airbnb URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and extract lodging data using Airbnb-specific parsing logic
4. WHEN a Booking.com URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and extract lodging data using Booking.com-specific parsing logic
5. WHEN a Hotels.com URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and extract lodging data using Hotels.com-specific parsing logic
6. WHEN an unsupported platform URL is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the platform is not supported

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want request and response data validation, so that I can rely on consistent data types and formats in API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request data is received THEN the system SHALL validate URLs using Pydantic HttpUrl validation
2. WHEN response data is generated THEN the system SHALL validate all fields match the defined Pydantic response models
3. WHEN flight data is returned THEN the system SHALL ensure origin_airport and destination_airport are strings, duration and segment are integers, and costs are floats
4. WHEN lodging data is returned THEN the system SHALL ensure name and location are strings, guest count and nights are integers, costs follow specified types, and dates are ISO format
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 422 with validation error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance optimization and rate limiting, so that the service remains responsive and avoids being blocked by target websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests are received concurrently THEN the system SHALL process them asynchronously using async/await patterns
2. WHEN requests are made to the same URL within a short timeframe THEN the system SHALL optionally serve cached results to improve performance
3. WHEN making requests to external sites THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to avoid IP blocking
4. WHEN external requests fail transiently THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN requests exceed 30-60 second timeout THEN the system SHALL terminate the request and return a timeout error
6. WHEN making web scraping requests THEN the system SHALL rotate User-Agent headers to avoid detection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive API documentation and health monitoring, so that I can monitor service status and provide clear API documentation to consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FastAPI application starts THEN the system SHALL provide auto-generated API documentation at the root endpoint
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/health` THEN the system SHALL return a health check response indicating service status
3. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the system SHALL display title "Travel Data Parser API" and version "1.0.0" in the documentation
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive details including timestamps, request details, and error context
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL support environment variable configuration for different deployment environments

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerization and deployment support, so that I can deploy the service consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is containerized THEN the system SHALL support Docker containerization with all required dependencies
2. WHEN deployed to production THEN the system SHALL support ASGI server setup with Gunicorn and Uvicorn
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for all configurable settings
4. WHEN deployed to production THEN the system SHALL configure CORS for production domains in addition to localhost
5. IF proxy support is needed THEN the system SHALL optionally support proxy configuration for external requests
